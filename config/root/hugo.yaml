    content: |-
      I am a Systems & Technical Operations Engineer, originally from the USA, though currently reside in Sweden. 

      I have a strong passion for snowboarding, photography, music, visually stimulating art, and traveling (and getting lost or having side-quests on the way). I also have a strong interest in science based subjects, ranging from Biology to Engineering.

      While a large portion of my current position involves Client Endpoint Management and IAM Management in Operations, I have recently taken an interest in ChatGPT, server-less infrastructure, and DevOps/SRE type workflows.
